# Assumption: We want know the level of developers.

We try eight indicators, company, commit_times, recent commit.

Indicator3 plots a figure about the frequency of the commit times. And we program a python file, `plot_frequency.py`.

Indicators details are in file `Indicators`. But some indicators we create are not used in the final programming.

`get_dev_infor.py` is used for geting ,extracting and cleaning the data from the git.

`dev_infor.csv` is the result. However, we made a subjective evaluation of the developer's level, which may not be accurate enough, but we collected information on the Internet and gave us a rating that we think is reasonable, using ten numbers (1-10).
