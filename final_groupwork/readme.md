## Assumption: We want know the level of developers.

We try eight indicators, company, commit_times, recent commit, e.g..

`plot_frequenct.py` is used for plots the indicator3, a figure about the frequency of the commit times.

`Indicators` contains all the indicators' details. But some indicators we created are not used in the final programming.

`get_dev_infor.py` is used for geting ,extracting and cleaning the data from the git.

`dev_infor.csv` is the result. However, we made a subjective evaluation of the developer's level, which may not be accurate enough, but we collected information on the Internet and gave us a rating that we think is reasonable, using ten numbers (1-10).
